## Description

- This repository contains a library of circuit templates.
- You can read more about the circom language in [the circom documentation webpage](https://docs.circom.io/).

## Organisation

This respository contains 5 folders:
- `circuits`: it contains the implementation of different cryptographic primitives in circom language.
- `test`: tests.

A description of the specific circuit templates for the `circuit` folder will be soon updated.

## Circuits to be added:
* tensordot
* Kronecker product
* 1-norm, 2-norm
* determinant
